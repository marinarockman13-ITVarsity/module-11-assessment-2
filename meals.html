                <p class="bg-primary">Beef Stroganoff may have hit peak popularity in America in the 1950s and 1960s</p>
                <p class="bg-primary"> The recipe originated in 17th century Russia and gets its name from Count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov, a diplomat from the Russian Stroganov family.</p>
                <p class="bg-primary">A Taste of Russia, "Count Stroganov's chef simply added some very Russian sour cream to a basic French mustard sauce." </p>
                <p class="bg-primary">It was poured over some beef and became a household hit. Thus, the legendary dish was born.</p>

                  <h3>Waldorf Salad 2</h3>
                  <p class="bg-primary">With yearnings coming on strong for the good old days, I feel like there’s a retro resurgence coming to home cooking. Or is it already here?</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">The Waldorf salad is said to have originated over 100 years ago at the Waldorf hotel in New York City. Starting out as a simple salad of apples, celery, and mayonnaise—ingredients that are in season all year long—over the years its flavor was tweaked with the addition of grapes and nuts added to the mix.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">I’ve been wanting to make a waldorf salad for sometime. I’ve just placed the salad in the fridge after following the directions. I’ll give an update after it chills.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Loved this recipe! My mom made this same salad with walnuts. Thanks for reminding me to make this, it was delicious and brought back great memories</p>
                  </div>
                <p class="bg-primary">The Waldorf salad, which features apples, celery, grapes, and chopped walnuts over a bed of greens, is named after the establishment that birthed it</p>

                  <h3>Dessert 3</h3>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Blend in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbly. Remove from heat.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Stir in instant bouillon, milk, water, and reserved mushroom liquid. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir for 1 minute.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary"> was never a fan of Chicken A La King but my husband asked me to try making it. I added 2 T. dry sherry and used all chicken broth in place of the water. I also used evaporated milk for the milk.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">This is really bland. I think I'd rather use a recipe that has cream of mushroom soup instead of flour. I had to double up on pepper just to give it some flavor. I doubt I'll use this one again.</p>
                  </div>
                <p class="bg-primary">Easy and elegant chicken dish. It's a great way to use leftover chicken or turkey. Green pepper and red pimientos make this a pretty dish to serve at Christmas or anytime. Serve over cooked rice, toast, or noodles. Can be made ahead and reheated.

                  <p class="bg-primary">I've been on the go quite a bit lately, with little time to cook for myself and/or admittedly, not in the mood to do so..</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">I picked up a couple of Salisbury Steak meals from Banquet at Dollar Tree for $1 each.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">It's quick, easy peasy to nuke and after adding some Cookies Flavor Enhancer, my favorite all purpose seasoning, the meal isn't bad.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Chips, perhaps America's favorite snack food....  Walk into just about any grocery store and they have an isle dedicated to them, classic potato chips,</p>

                <p class="bg-primary">The Salisbury steak got its name from Dr. James Henry Salisbury, a 19th-century physician who first served it to Civil War soldiers during a study..</p>
