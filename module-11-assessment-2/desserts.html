                <h3>Peanut Butter Cookie Bars</h3>
                <p class="bg-primary">One of my all-time favorite vegan desserts! A sprinkle of flaky sea salt makes the nutty,
                   chocolaty flavors in these no-bake cookie bars pop.</p>
                <p class="bg-primary">So yummy… I’m having trouble not drooling all over my keyboard right now.</p>
                <p class="bg-primary">he last thing I’m going to gush about is the personal obsession I have with their peanut butter.
                   I know it seems like peanut butters would all be created (somewhat) equal, but theirs has the best texture and
                    flavor I’ve ever tasted – just look at the photo near the top of this post to see how oozy it is.</p>

                  <h3>Sex in a Pan</h3>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Why Is It Called Sex In A Pan?
                    The name itself is hilarious for a dessert, and hundreds of you have commented on here telling me all the other names that this pudding dessert goes by. 
                    I think it’s called sex in a pan because it’s six layers and from six layers in a pan it got to sex in a pan</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Sex in a Pan – crazy name for a dessert, but it’s one of the best desserts you’ll ever have, 
                    it’s mostly a pudding dessert with a crunchy pecan bottom crust.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">My favorite summertime dessert. I’ve made it for at least 40 years. 
                    Given to me by a dear friend in Arkansas and she called it Four layer dessert.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">My family always called this Chocolate Delight. lol. 
                    I don’t think I could call it Sex in the Pan either. LOL.</p>

                  <p class="bg-primary">Meet the BEST vegan ice cream. Ever.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Yep, I said it. Over the years, I’ve tried all sorts of vegan ice cream recipes, 
                    ones with bases ranging from frozen bananas to cashew milk to almond milk. For me, there’s no contest. 
                    As far as dairy-free ice cream goes, coconut ice cream is by far the best.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">This looks absolutely amazing. .</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">I love tahini! This ice cream looks so delicious and perfect for the summer!.</p>

                  <h3>Malva Pudding</h3>
                  <p class="bg-primary">My nan was telling me fond memories of her childhood and an aunt who has since moved to canada made her this. 
                    She couldn’t contact said aunt or find a recipe. I made her this for her birthday and it bought tears to her eyes..</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">I tried this again yesterday and baked for an hour til it was golden brown. 
                    I turned the oven off and left it in there. As a result there wasn't any custard left, but it tasted a lot better than last time! 
                    Next time i'll take it out of the oven once it's done, even if we don't eat it straightaway.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">Perfect winter fare - easy, quick and so tasty.</p>
                  <p class="bg-primary">This pudding turned out perfectly and looked good. Flavourwise it was a bit too eggy for me, 
                    this could be because I reduced the sugar. Next time I will use the full quantity of sugar..</p>
                </div>
                <p class="bg-primary">An easy throw-together dessert that forms a crust, custard and topping while in the oven. Easy.</p>
